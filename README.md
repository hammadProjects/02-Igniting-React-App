- What is `Parcel/Webpack`? Why do we need it?
- What is `.parcel-cache`?
- What is `npx`?
- What is difference between `dependencies vs devDependencies`?
- What is Tree Shaking?
- What is Hot Module Replacement?
- What is `.gitignore`? What should we add and not add into it?
- What is the difference between `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files?
- What is `node_modules`? Is it a good idea to push that on git?
- What is the `dist` folder?
- What is `browserlists`? and Read about different bundlers: vite, webpack, parcel
- Read about: `^-caret` and `~-tilde`
