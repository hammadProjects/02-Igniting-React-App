I have learned about: 
- What is `npm`?
- What is a bundler? Why do we need parcel?
- What is `.parcel-cache`?
- What is `npx`?
- What is difference between `dependencies and devDependencies`?
- What is Tree Shaking?
- What is HMR?
- What is `.gitignore`? What should we put into this?
- What is the difference between `package.json and package-lock.json` files?
- What is `node_modules`? And why should we not push this to github?
- What is `dist` folder?
- What is `browserlists`?
- What is the difference between `^-caret vs ~-tilde`

I have learned how we can ignite our React app step by step.
